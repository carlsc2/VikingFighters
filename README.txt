Game AI
Final Project
Craig Carlson
-------------------


To run in Unity Editor: go to main scene and press play

To run standalone: launch final_project.exe (requires build)


There are 2 buttons restart and start. They do exactly that. The
rest of the demo is autonomous. Press escape to exit the standalone.
